# Modified-booth-algorithm

It can be defined as an algorithm or method of multiplying binary numbers in twoâ€™s complement notation. It is a simple method to multiply binary numbers in which multiplication is performed with repeated addition operations by following the booth algorithm. Again this booth algorithm for multiplication operation is further modified and hence, named as modified booth algorithm.

# Modified Booth Algorithm Encoder

This modified booth multiplier is used to perform high-speed multiplications using modified booth algorithm. We can reduce half the number of partial product. Radix-4 booth algorithm used here increases the speed of multiplier and reduces the area of multiplier circuit. In this algorithm, every second column is taken and multiplied by 0 or +1 or +2 or -1 or -2 instead of multiplying with 0 or 1 after shifting and adding of every column of the booth multiplier. Thus, half of the partial product can be reduced using this booth algorithm. Based on the multiplier bits, the process of encoding the multiplicand is performed by radix-4 booth encoder.

Hence, to design n-bit parallel multipliers only 2n partial products are generated by using booth algorithm. Thus, the propagation delay to run circuit, complexity of the circuit, and power consumption can be reduced.
